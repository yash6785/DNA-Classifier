# DNA Sequence Classification Using Machine Learning and NLP
The project, DNA Sequence Classification Using Machine Learning and 
NLP, explores innovative techniques to classify DNA sequences into species, 
such as human, chimpanzee, and dog. By treating DNA as textual data, 
Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods like k-mer tokenization and 
Bag of Words (BoW) are employed to extract patterns from sequences. A 
Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier is developed to analyze these features 
and predict species accurately. The system is designed to be scalable, 
enabling future integration of more species and advanced algorithms like 
Word2Vec or transformers. The outcomes of this project have applications in 
genomics, medical diagnostics, and biological research, with potential for 
cloud-based real-time deployment.. 
The innovative methodology adopted in this project leverages the 
convergence of machine learning and NLP for DNA classification, presenting 
a robust framework for species identification. By implementing k-mer 
tokenization, the DNA sequences are translated into meaningful patterns, 
enabling computational analysis using linguistic models. The integration of 
Bag of Words enhances the ability to capture unique sequence features. The 
use of a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier ensures an efficient balance 
between accuracy and computational cost. This system opens avenues for 
advancements, such as integrating neural network-based embeddings (e.g., 
Word2Vec, BERT) to improve classification precision. The project also 
emphasizes scalability, with cloud-based deployment potential, allowing 
researchers to perform large-scale, real-time DNA analysis. Applications 
extend to biodiversity conservation, personalized medicine, and evolutionary 
studies, making this an impactful contribution to computational genomics..
